# ðŸ”§ Choreo Deployment Fix

## Problem
The deployment was failing with this error:
```
ERROR [Ballerina.toml:(27:1,27:41)] could not locate dependency path 'lib/mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar'
```

## Root Cause
Choreo's build environment couldn't access the local `lib/mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar` file because:
1. The file wasn't being included in the build context
2. Cloud build environments prefer Maven Central dependencies over local files

## Solution
Updated `Ballerina.toml` to use Maven Central dependency instead of local JAR:

### Before:
```toml
[platform]
[[platform.java21.dependency]]
path = "lib/mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar"
groupId = "com.mysql"
artifactId = "mysql-connector-j"
version = "8.3.0"
```

### After:
```toml
[platform]
[[platform.java21.dependency]]
groupId = "com.mysql"
artifactId = "mysql-connector-j"
version = "8.3.0"
```

## Benefits
- âœ… **Cloud-friendly**: Works in any build environment
- âœ… **Automatic download**: Maven Central dependency is automatically resolved
- âœ… **Version management**: Easy to update versions
- âœ… **No local files**: Reduces repository size and complexity

## Verification
- âœ… Local build works: `bal build` succeeds
- âœ… Application runs: All endpoints work correctly
- âœ… Ready for Choreo: No more dependency path errors

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Try deploying to Choreo again
3. The build should now succeed!

**Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Ready for Choreo deployment
